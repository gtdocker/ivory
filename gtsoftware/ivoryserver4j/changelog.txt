                    Copyright by GT Software, Inc.

Build 6.2.0.20171107

- Do not count SYNC message response segments to count in
    received segment count.

- Resolve a build issue in the Linux build.
 
Build 6.2.0.20171101
 
- Java Off Host Server Only - Added logic to either use a 
    secure or unsecure connection when using IMS Connect. To determine 
    what type of connection to use, modify the 
    “Use Secure Connection (Java Server Only)” Boolean property in 
    the corresponding IMS Point Node in the diagram.

- Documentation – provide steps to properly configure 
    AT-TLS on the mainframe.

 
Build 6.1.0.20170915

- Add isNulls function, styled after isBlanks
 
- Add new date format DDMMMYY
 
- Add support for CM1, SL=Confirm to IMS Connect
 
- Updates for GIIIMSC2 to better handle some client 
 options
 
- Remove support for UniKix TPE server.

Build 6.1.0.20170728 

- Add isBlanks function

- Allow isNumeric function to test PIC 9 type fields.  
(Previously the function was only useful for testing strings for 
numeric values before moving them to a numeric field.  This update 
makes the function useful for testing a numeric field for a valid 
value prior to using it in a movement.)

- Treat a timeout on a read for a response to an ACK 
message sent to IMS Connect as normal.

- Fix an error in parsing REST Request URI's which would
cause the proper operation to not be found.  The URI style in question
would contain a variable node in the URI but ended in a constant node.

/<variable in URI>/EndingIsAFixedValue

 Build 6.0.0.20170327

-  Additional updates have been made to support REST Service Operation based projects:

                  The server will now generate default responses for HEAD and OPTIONS requests
                  based on the attributes of the project.  It will do this if the user does not
                  build operations for the HEAD and/or OPTIONS http verbs.  The OPTIONS response
                  will include any defined verbs in operations in the project in the Allow: http
                  header with the addition of HEAD and OPTIONS, if needed.

                  The server will now allow a user defined 404 response.

                  The server will respond with a 404 response for potential REST URI's which cannot 
                  be matched to an operation.

                  The RESTRequest query string parameter is not needed for a service which is defined
                  with REST Service operation nodes.

                  A new project resource file has been added, the .ivr file, which will allow mapping
                  of the http verb and sub path portions off of the base path of the service to the 
                  correct operation.

                  The server will accept user input from the query string and path variables as included 
                  in a project.  For PUT and POST requests, XML or JSON input data will ba accepted as 
                  defined in the project.

 Build 6.0.0.20161205
 
- Ivory Server will now support projects which are dedicated 
to RESTful services.

- Ivory Server for zOS and CICS versions: SAMPLIB now contains a 
copy book with IVCALL2 for COBOL & PL1.

Member names are IVCALL2C and IVCALL2P respectively.
                     
 
 Build 5.1.4.20161111

 - The Ivory Server should no longer crash when processing large MTOM 
 responses by attempting to free storage multiple times.


 Build 5.1.3.20160920

- VSAM Manager module of Ivory Server for zOS can now be configured 
thru a set of parameters instead of hard coded constants. This new 
type of configuration is optional and if not used the Server uses default
arguments in the VSAM Manager.

- VSAM Manager module of Ivory Server enhanced with garbage collector 
routine that helps to prevent the exhaustion of its RPL Pool table and 
reduces the chances of message GTMAI146A. Together with the configuration 
parameters mentioned above, this routine allows users to increase/decrease 
the size of RPL pool and/or tune the performance of VSAM access.
             
- Ivory Server documentation now describes how to code and implement VSAM 
parameters and eventual changes in JCL.

- Fixed an issue with parsing Web Service Client Point node respsonses which 
could cause issues in data movements, especially when arrays are involved.  
This could lead to empty  moves, duplicated moves, or seemingly correct 
results.  These issues were more apparent in JSON responses.

- Web Service Client Point nodes which used wsdl to describe the payload 
would not process correctly for wsdl's which used certain encoding styles 
when the service was REST/JSON.  The code will force a good encoding style 
for called services which return REST/JSON.
                   
 
 Build 5.1.2.20160901
 
- Fix improper handling of special 3270 aid values for 3270 Point Nodes 
on Linux servers.

- Update code which calls delegate processes on the Ivory Server for z/OS 
to issue LOADs and DELETEs for the called routines when appropriate.

 Build 5.1.2.20160818

- Added support for complex types for Fault Details when 
using the CLI wizard to generate a project
             
- Added support for turning on tracing in a callable project
by setting a flag in the IVCALL2 header
             
- Fixed an error where fields in optional structures would 
be moved incorrectly in callable projects
             
- Fixed an error where a web service client point node
for a RESTful service would look for a SOAP Action and 
generate an error if one was not found
              
 Build 5.1.1.20160427

- The SYNCLEVEL on IMS Connect requests could be set 
   improperly, resulting in a "random" syclevel.  This should be 
   fixed.

- Input copybooks with ODO arrays could cause a server 
   crash if the input and output copybooks defined for a node were
   not the same.  This should be fixed.

- Time zone offsets could be improperly parsed into and out of the fractional 
  seconds portion of a Time/DateTime field.  This should be fixed.  
  
  Please note that Ivory does not currently support time zone offsets.  
  They are currently stripped from the fields. 

 Build 5.1.0.20160229
 
- Updates to avoid storage violations (SIGSEGV) when a project 
  deployed by an old Studio Is executed on a new (4.5.1+) server with 
  unbounded Base64 fields.

- Add new properties to Web Service Client Point Node to override
  the existing behavior of setting the SOAPAction http header.  The existing
  behavior is to set the SOAPAction as the concatenation of the target
  namespace and web service operation.
  
  The updated settings consist of a field to toggle the override behavior 
  and a field to customize the SOAPAction.  The field which contains the
  SOAPAction will initially contain the SOAPAction as imported in the wsdl.
  If the override field is set from true to false, the SOAPAction
  customization will be reloaded from the wsdl definition.  If the SOAPAction 
  override is in effect, then when Ivory Server makes the Web Service Client
  call the SOAPAction will be enclosed in quotes in the HTTP header, as 
  demonstrated below.

  SOAPAction field in Studio - target SOAP Action

  resulting http header      - SOAPAction: "target SOAP Action"

  Note that an empty SOAPAction field in the Studio will result in:

  SOAPAction: ""
  
- Added support for UTF-16BE (big endian) fields in USAGE NATIONAL
  PIC N data items in copybooks  for Link Point nodes.

- Added support to continue after error (application abend) for 
  Link3270 projects by adding a 3270 point node (set to catch the 
  error) after the 3270 Action node.
              
- Added support for mixed case passwords for inbound http requests.  
  This can be turned on by adding AllowMixedCasePassword=1 in the 
  {AUTHORIZATION} section of Ivory:/etc/ivorycwi.ini (if using 
  TCPIPSERVICES) and/or Ivory:/etc/giiipasp.ini (if using the IVAS
  listener transaction).
						 
-IMS Connect exit GIIIMSC2 has been reworked to support IBM APAR 
 PI26856. It can be reassembled and linked in accordance to the IMS 
 release level of the DATASTORE. It currently supports IMS 11, 12, 13 
 & 14. The distributed load module is assembled using IMS 13 settings.
             
-	Ivory Server for zOS has been updated to support IBM APAR PI26856; 
  it uses the IRM_F2_GENCID flag to make sure a different CLIENT ID 
  generated to avoid DUPLICATES rejections
              
- Added TCPIP Stack name parms to allow Ivory to use a secondary IP 
  stack. 

- Added MaxTrace parm to stop tracing at xxxx  Megabytes.     
 
  
 Build 5.0.0.20150420
 
- Fix several issues with JSON processing in the code.  
  These include fixing the parsing of wrapped arrays in JSON and
  no longer attempting to format attributes.
    
- Update the server to handle some new internal file 
  formats related to changing references to SOAP in projects to
  a more generic service.

- A message about the GTHFSCFG DD being missing has been 
  removed from being issued to avoid writing too many messages to
  the GWAOUT log.  
 
 
 Build 4.6.0.20150223
 
 - Added timeout support for the IMS Connect interface.

- Fix sharing of GWAOUT, GWAERR, GWAIN so that the file is 
  not closed when it is being used by another task.  (This could 
  trigger a S0C4 abend.

- Update to resolve a memory leak when Ivory modules are 
  linked to multiple times in a task.

- Change the EZA INITAPIX call to an INITAPI until Ivory
  has a facility to set the TCPIP stack name to use.

- Add new module GIICALC, this is a CICS compatible version
  of GIICALZ.  That is the program will CALL GIICALZ, but INCLUDE 
  GIICALC at link-edit/bind.

- Add support for the Ivory2 header to the IDMS GIICALIA
  interface.

- Add support for callable timeouts to the IDMS GIICALIA
  interface.

- Add new routines to allow call of non-authorized modules 
  a more protected environment, rather than using an SVC to switch
  authorization mode.

- The GTCTR copybook fields would be populated based upon
  the loop count of the last loop which contains that array element
  as a part of the move operations.  The code will now track the 
  maximum index value calculated for the field during project 
  execution.

- Several updates for better handling http multipart uploads 
  where the client sends an incomplete/invalid message.  The server 
  could go to high CPU utilization when the socket session closed.
  The server should better detect the soceket closure and exit more 
  gracefully.

- Support suppression of optional time simple type tag 
  generation for callable services when the passed in data is 
  spaces.
